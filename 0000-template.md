# Summary

Brief explanation of the feature.

# Basic example

If the proposal involves a new or changed coding standard, include a basic code 
example. Omit this section if it's not applicable.

# Motivation

Why are we doing this? What use cases does it support? What is the expected
outcome?

Please focus on explaining the motivation so that if this RFC is not accepted,
the motivation could be used to develop alternative solutions. In other words,
enumerate the constraints you are trying to solve without coupling them too
closely to the solution you have in mind.

# Detailed design

This is the bulk of the RFC. Explain the design in enough detail for somebody
familiar with WordPress Coding Standards to understand, and for somebody 
familiar with the implementation to implement. This should get into specifics 
and corner-cases, and include examples of how the feature is used. Any new 
terminology should be defined here.

# Drawbacks

Why should we *not* do this? Please consider:

- implementation cost, both in term of code size and complexity
- the impact on teaching developers WordPress Coding Standards
- integration of this feature with other existing and planned features

There are tradeoffs to choosing any path. Attempt to identify them here.

# Alternatives

What other alternatives, if any, have been considered? What is the impact of 
not doing this?

# Adoption strategy

If we implement this proposal, how will existing WordPress Coding Standards
developers adopt it? Is this a breaking change? Can we write a codemod? Should 
we coordinate with other projects or libraries?

# How we teach this

What names and terminology work best for these concepts and why? How is this
idea best presented? 

Would the acceptance of this proposal mean the WordPress Coding Standards 
documentation must be re-organized or altered? 

# Handbook Content

Everything in this section should be _word-for-word_ what is proposed to go into the handbook - code examples, explanation of how WordPress Core may differ from usage of the feature etc. Include a section title or what section of the handbook this should go into if it should be added to an existing section. Keep it concise and readable.

# Unresolved questions

Optional, but suggested for first drafts. What parts of the design are still
TBD?
